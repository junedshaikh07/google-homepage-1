This is my first independent project at The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
I decided to utilize flexbox for this project, so I completed "What the Flexbox!" tutorial, by Wes Bos (https://flexbox.io/).
In addition, I utilized Font Awesome for the small icons. I had tried other icons in the past, but I like font awesome the best, because you can make easily style the icons like a font. (https://fontawesome.com/?from=io)
In the Flexbox tutorial, I learned the importance of using an autoprefixer for my CSS file, so the flexbox properties will be interpreted correctly by older browswers. However, Wes Bos recommended installing gulp.js to maximize my workflow. However, I had a difficult time installing Ruby, most particularly Rbenv, so I did not want to install more then Odin expected at this time. I am not sure I had problems with the installation because I had previously set-up different versions of homebrew or because of recent MacOS Catalina update. Therefore, I used an online autoprefixer. (https://autoprefixer.github.io/)
I learned a lot about flexbox through the tutorial & creating this page. I decided to nest flexbox, so the entire page is a flex container and the three main elements (header, section, and footer) are both a flex item & a flex container. This allowed me to use the "easy" formatting capabilities of flexbox to place the different elements.
